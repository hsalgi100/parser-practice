Input is a file that will look like:
	d = 5406
	z = 45687
	x = 435
	y = 464
Output is the values of the letters with the letters themselves. Note that spaces and equal signs matter, so you have to match it exactly.

The input file will consist of the letters a-z, but there could be repeated letters and there could also be ommitted letters.

If a letter is repeated in the input file, you only output the last occurrence of that letter. 
	a = 5
	b = 20
	a = 10
Outputs:
	a: 10
	b: 20
Note that outputs are colons and not equal signs.

Some letters can be equated to 0 in the input, these letters should not be shown with their values in the output (NO ZEROS).

If the letters don't repeat, then just output the letters themselves and their values.

The output has to be in alphabetical order.

Assume that all values on the right are integers.


For Duplicates:
- Store first one
- if second one appears, replace first one with second one
- if third one appears, replace second one with third one
- General: if one already exists, just replace it with the new one until there are no more new ones

HINTS:
- Use String.split()
- Use Integer.parseInt()
- Use Scanner
  - .nextLine()
  - .hasNextLine()
